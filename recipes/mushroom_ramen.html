        <p>
            This isn’t your typical instant ramen noodle recipe. What sets it apart are the hearty mushrooms which are beautifully browned to amplify the earthy mushroom 
            flavors and aroma. I also added a few seasoning ingredients like scallions, homemade broth, and chili peppers to layers of flavor. Best of all, this recipe 
            comes together in no time. With just a couple of additional ingredients and a few minutes of prep time, you’ll be able to enjoy a hot steaming bowl of mushroom 
            ramen in the comfort of your home, in just 15 minutes!

        <ul>
            <li>1 pack instant ramen (I like Shin Ramen)</li>
            <li>500-525 ml (2 1/4 cup) broth or water</li>
            <li>8 oz assorted mushrooms I used enoki, shiitake, oyster mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 chopped scallions</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>1 sliced chili pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by prepping the mushrooms. Slice the shiitake mushrooms to 1/2 inch piece. 
                Rip the enoki and oyster mushrooms into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot over medium heat. Add shiitake and oyster mushrooms, and cook until charred and browned on both sides.</li>
            <li>Add neutral oil then toss in the white part of the scallions. 
                Add 1/4 of the instant ramen seasoning packet and quickly stir into the mushrooms and scallions to prevent the seasoning from burning. </li>
            <li>After 30 seconds, pour in the broth or water and bring to a boil. 
                Add the remaining instant ramen seasoning packet, noodles, and dried vegetable flakes (if any). </li>
            <li>Add enoki mushrooms, egg, green part of the scallions and sliced pepper. Cook the noodles to your desired doneness 
                - I recommend cooking it about 30 sceonds to 1 minute less than the recommended cooking instructions for al dente.</li>
        </ol>
